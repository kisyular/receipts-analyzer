## ðŸš€ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Extract the Files

1. Download the zip file you received via email
2. Extract it to a folder on your computer (e.g., `C:\receipts-analyzer` or `/home/user/receipts-analyzer`)
3. Open a command prompt/terminal in that folder

**After extraction, your folder should look like this:**

```
receipts-analyzer/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py               # Main application file
â”œâ”€â”€ startup.py           # Startup script
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md            # This documentation file
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html           # Main web interface
â”œâ”€â”€ analytics.html       # Analytics dashboard
â”œâ”€â”€ test_endpoints.py    # Test suite
â”œâ”€â”€ TEST_README.md       # Test documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ azure.yaml           # Azure configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ receipt_images/      # Folder for storing receipt images
â””â”€â”€ uploads/             # Temporary upload folder
```

**Important:** Make sure you see all these files after extraction. If any are missing, the zip file may be corrupted.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

In your command prompt/terminal, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Accounts

#### MongoDB Database (Free)

1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Click "Try Free" and create an account
3. Create a new cluster (choose the free option)
4. Click "Connect" â†’ "Connect your application"
5. Copy the connection string (looks like: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/`)

#### Azure Document Intelligence (Free Trial)

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com
2. Create a free account if you don't have one
3. Search for "Document Intelligence" in the search bar

5. Fill in the details and create the resource
6. Go to "Keys and Endpoint" and copy:
   - Endpoint URL (looks like: `https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`)
   - Key 1 (long string of letters and numbers)

### Step 4: Create Environment File

In your project folder, create a file named `.env` with this content:

```env
# Replace with your MongoDB connection string

2. **Upload Test**: Try uploading any receipt image
3. **Analytics Test**: Check the analytics dashboard
4. **Error Handling**: Try uploading non-image files

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project folder:

```env
# Required: MongoDB connection string
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/receipts_db

# Required: Azure Document Intelligence endpoint
AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/

```

### App Settings

- **File size limit**: 10MB maximum
- **Supported formats**: JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, HEIF
- **Image storage**: Local `receipt_images/` folder
- **Database**: MongoDB collections created automatically

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### 1. "Failed to connect to MongoDB"

**Problem**: Can't connect to database
**Solutions**:

- Check your `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file
- Make sure your MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
- Verify your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas

#### 2. "Azure Document Intelligence error"

**Problem**: AI analysis not working
**Solutions**:

- Check your Azure credentials in the `.env` file
- Make sure your Azure Document Intelligence resource is active
- Verify you have enough credits in your Azure account

#### 3. "File must be an image"

**Problem**: Upload rejected
**Solutions**:

- Use only image files (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, HEIF)
- Make sure the file is actually an image, not a PDF or document
- Check file size is under 10MB

#### 4. "Address already in use"

**Problem**: Port 8000 is busy
**Solutions**:

- Close other applications using port 8000
- Or change the port in `startup.py`:
  ```python
  uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8001)  # Change 8000 to 8001
  ```

#### 5. "Module not found" errors

**Problem**: Missing Python packages
**Solutions**:

- Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Make sure you're in the correct folder
- Try: `pip install --upgrade pip` first

### Debug Mode

To see detailed error messages, edit `app.py` and change:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Check Logs

Look for error messages in your command prompt/terminal where you ran the app.

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Tips

### For Better Receipt Analysis

- **Clear images**: Well-lit, focused photos work best
- **Good angles**: Take photos straight-on, not at angles
- **High resolution**: Use the highest quality your camera supports
- **Avoid shadows**: Make sure text is clearly visible

### For Faster Processing

- **Smaller files**: Keep images under 5MB for faster uploads
- **Good internet**: Faster upload speeds help
- **Close other apps**: Free up memory and CPU

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- **Local only**: The app runs on your computer, data stays local
- **No internet required**: Once set up, works offline (except for AI analysis)
- **Secure storage**: Receipt images stored locally in `receipt_images/` folder
- **No data sharing**: Your data never leaves your computer

## ðŸ“± Mobile Usage

### On Your Phone

1. **Find your computer's IP address**:

   - Windows: Run `ipconfig` in Command Prompt
   - Mac/Linux: Run `ifconfig` in Terminal
   - Look for something like `192.168.1.100`

2. **Access from phone**:
   - Make sure phone and computer are on same WiFi
   - Open browser on phone
   - Go to: `http://192.168.1.100:8000` (replace with your computer's IP)

### Camera Upload

- Use the "Take Photo" button for best results
- Hold phone steady and well-lit
- Make sure receipt text is clear and readable

## ðŸ”„ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- **Backup data**: Copy the `receipt_images/` folder to a safe location
- **Clean up**: Delete old receipts you don't need
- **Update Python**: Keep Python updated for security

### Database Backup

Your data is stored in MongoDB Atlas, which has automatic backups. For extra safety:

1. Go to your MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Click "Backup" in the left menu
3. Create manual backups when needed
